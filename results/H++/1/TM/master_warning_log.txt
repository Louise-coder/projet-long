WARNING: pre-optimization of polar hydrogen positions (AMBER pol_h) has failed. This may indicate problems with the input structure, such as steric clashes. While the calculation has proceeded, the accuracy of the computed pK values may be affected: it may be a good idea to check your structure throughly. You should be particularly alarmed if the next optimization step also fails.
     
Optimizing positions of the added hydrogens      
WARNING: Optimization (energy-minimization) of the added hydrogens has failed. Your structure may contain steric inconsistencies. 
These may have been present in the original PDB structure or 
have resulted from an attempt to add 
missing heavy atoms. The calculation has proceeded with unoptimized, unrelaxed structure. The results may be suspicious, especially if the problem has occured 
in the immediate vicinity of the groups of interest. 
This is true of ANY pK-predicting method you may be using.  We suggest
that you critically examine your input structure.

Adding missing atoms from AMBER databases 
</br> <br>FAILURE: </br> 

<br> TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: An error occured in the setup ( tleap ) step of processing 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1. The auxillary program pdb2pqr.sh was unable to produce the (AMBER format) files tmp.top and tmp.crd needed for the next step. </br> 

PROBABLE CAUSE (1) The input 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1 file contains very nonstandard atom/residue names that were unrecognized. </br> 
PROBABLE CAUSE (2) The input 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1 file has multiple chains not separated by a TER. </br>
PROBABLE CAUSE (3) The input 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1 file contains DNA or RNA with a 5' phosphate group. </br>
PROBABLE CAUSE (4) The input 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1 file is in the OLD (before 2008) PDB FORMAT. If it contains G,A,C,T for DNA these should be renamed to DG,DA,DC, and DT respectively. </br>
PROBABLE CAUSE (5) H-atoms may have been incorrectly added by the 'reduce' program,
which is used in H++ to try and correct the orientations of ASN, GLN, and HIS.
<br>

<br> SUGGESTED RECOVERY STEPS: If the problem is just (1),  look up the 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1.tleap.err in the >>Files generated so far below<<. 
Search for word >>FATAL<< -- atom names next to it were not recognized. 
You can either change these to the standard PDB names in your input file, or delete them completely (ONLY as a last resort! See FAQ ), 
in which case they  will be added  
back based on the standard amino-acid configurations from AMBER database. </br> 

<br> If your structure has multiple chains, it is likely that the problem is just (2). Make sure you insert a TER in-between (typically after each terminal group, likely containing an OXT atom). For 
example, a message in 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1.tleap.err such as this one: | FATAL:  Atom .R(PHE 513).A(OXT 21) does not have a type | is likely  indicative of problem (2). </br>
 
<br> If your structure contains DNA or RNA with a 5' phosphate group, 
it is likely that the problem is just (3). 
AMBER does not recognize phosphate groups at the 5' end of DNA or RNA, 
which will produce an error (look in 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1.tleap.err) such as:
| FATAL:  Atom .R(DA5 1).A(P 32) does not have a type |. 
To get around this problem, try deleting the 5' phosphate group from the input pdb file. 
<br>

<br> If the problem is with the H-atoms added by 'reduce',
you should see an error in 0.15_80_10_pH5_corrected2-npc1.tleap.err such as:
| FATAL:  Atom .R(CYX 104).A(HG 11) does not have a type. |
To get around this problem, 
try de-selecting the option for 
'correcting the orientations of ASN, ...',
on the parameter input screen
